============

A command shell for managing the Linux LIO kernel target
--------------------------------------------------------
targetcli-fb is a command-line interface for configuring the LIO generic
SCSI target, present in 3.x Linux kernel versions.

This runs with Python 2.7 and 2to3 is run by setup.py to run on Python 3.

In-repo packaging
-----------------
Packaging scripts for RPM and DEB are included, but these are to make end-user
custom packaging easier -- distributions tend to maintain their own packaging
scripts separately. If you run into issues with packaging, start with opening
a bug on your distro's bug reporting system.

Some people do use these scripts, so we want to keep them around. Fixes for
any breakage you encounter are welcome.

"fb" -- "free branch"
---------------------

targetcli-fb is a fork of the "targetcli" code written by RisingTide Systems.
The "-fb" differentiates between the original and this version.
Please ensure to use either all "fb" versions of the targetcli components --
targetcli, rtslib, and configshell, or stick with all non-fb versions, since
they are no longer strictly compatible.
